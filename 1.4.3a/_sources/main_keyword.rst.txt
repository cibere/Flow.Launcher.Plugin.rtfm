Main Keyword
============

The main keyword lets you quickly access the settings webserver, reload the cache, or open up the log file. The default main keyword is ``rtfm``, but it can be configured in the plugin's settings (see :doc:`settings` for more info). It will also return a list of added manuals with quick access to querying them via flow's auto complete functionality and the result callbacks. The results will redirect to the appropriate place depending on your condense keywords setting.

The main keyword can also be used to access your added manuals with the following format: ``{main keyword} {manual keyword}`` and optionally a query: ``{main keyword} {manual keyword} {query}``.
