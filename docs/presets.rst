Presets
========
Presets are special implementations for specific websites that don't conform to specific standards, or aren't easily indexable. When you add a manual/doc, the plugin will automatically check if against the list of current presets to see if there are any for the manual/doc, and if not, it will try to guess which standard it conforms to. 

Preset Index
-------------

This is a list of manuals/docs that the plugin has specially designed parsers to handle.

.. NOTE::
    Got a manual/doc not listed that you want added? Create a `github issue <https://github.com/cibere/Flow.Launcher.Plugin.rtfm/issues>`__ asking for it, or send me a message on `discord <https://discord.com/users/894312088762220605>`__.
