v0.2.0

- redo offline docs instructions
- Add the ability to have "live" lookups (disable the usage of a cache for a library)
- rewrite the settings code to store your libraries in a `libraries.pickle` file, away from the standard flow plugin setting.
- make the file not found error to be more human readable
- Allow local docs without the need to use file protocol urls
    - Convert file protocol urls to normal paths for backward compatibility
